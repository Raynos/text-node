/*
OBSERVATIONS.

collection do not maintain any histroy.
they only hold buckets of objects.

set properties like order
are maintained by properties of the objects.

each level emits when it has changed.
and the next level is responsible for deciding when to
flush the changes.

OBJECT
  set       //set a value
  get       //retrive a value, or the cur state
  flush     //apply queued local changes
  update    //apply an remote update

  'queue'   //when a local change has happened
  'update'  //when changes have been applied. (local or remote)

SET
  set/add   //set a inner object.
  get       //retrive a inner object/or state
  flush     //apply queued local changes. 
  update    //apply an update

  'queue'   //when a local change has been made.
  'update'  //when changes are applied. (local or remote)

each type implements these methods...
.. but differently.
