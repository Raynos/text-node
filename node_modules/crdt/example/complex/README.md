# Complex

Here is a more complex example, 
there are widgets for chat, shared mouse pointers,
and a todo list, that is all replicated
in "realtime".

You can add items to the todo list, 
and drag them to other sections.

This is all updated in .real-time.

Also! the todo is persisted _on each client_
so that part of the app works offline.

It could also be persisted on the server,
it wouldn't make any difference to the app!

Chat doesn't need persistence, and neither does mouse.
